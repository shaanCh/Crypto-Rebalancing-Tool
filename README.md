## Description
I utilized AI and Machine Learning with TensorFlow to train a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model to forecast price movements based on historical data. The tool will help make smarter decisions about when and how to rebalance your portfolio.

## Background
Portfolio rebalancing involves adjusting the asset allocations within an investment portfolio. In the world of cryptocurrency, rebalancing serves to manage risk and maintain a desired asset allocation in the face of market volatility. For example, if your portfolio is composed of 60% Bitcoin (BTC) and 40% Ethereum (ETH), a significant increase in BTCâ€™s price might unbalance this distribution. Rebalancing ensures that the portfolio returns to its intended allocation.

The stock market is very unpredictable, let alone cryptocurrencies. Many people spend a lot of time trying to read charts with techniqle analysis, wait for credible news, or try to do their own research on different assets. One thing, I've learned is that most coins in the crypto world follow the king of all cryptos, Bitcoin. 

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is the first coin to be introduced in the Web3 era and its known for its decentralization of sending or recieving money. It's the most valued coin out to this day and will be for a while. The only thing it lacks is utility. Many of these other coins you see in the market today have a use or are known for a certain task using Web3 technology. </br>

For Example:
- Solana:
	- Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers users fast speeds and affordable costs using smart contracts and decentralized applications
 - Ethereum
	- Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain that powers decentralized applications (dApps) through smart contracts, without being controlled by a centralized entity.
   	- Ethereum allows for the creation of ERC-20 tokens for utility purposes such as paying trading fees, or as stores of value

## Purpose
  Bitcoin is known to be the representation of what the crypto markets have been feeling, either Bullish or Bearish. If bitcoin has been going down a couple 
 thousands of dollars the past number of days or weeks then usually most of the crypto coins will follow that same bearish pattern and true is for vice versa.
 
  The purpose of this application is to track the bitcoin price using the amount of bitcoin or ethereum you have and your goal target amount. Using those values the application will tell you how much of either coin you should buy or sell in order to reach that target amount based on the AI models prediction. This will efficiently rebalance and update you whether bitcoin is trending downwards or upwards.
